Test Case v1.2 by Solistra
=============================================================================

Summary
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This script provides a simple unit testing framework for RPG Maker VX Ace
with very simple expectation-style formatting for test cases. Essentially,
this script allows you to use test-driven development from within RPG Maker
VX Ace without depending on an external Ruby installation. This is primarily
a scripter's tool.

Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  There is no succinct way to summarize the usage of this script. However,
this script is heavily documented with examples if you wish to simply consult
the supplied documentation. In addition, a usage tutorial is available at
[SES VXA](http://sesvxace.wordpress.com/2014/04/10/a-case-for-unit-testing/).

  Note that the usage tutorial for this script makes heavy use of the
Assertions extension. Ensure that you are using this extension before you
review the tutorial.

Extensions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This script only provides the core SES Test Case framework needed to create
and run unit tests. In addition to the core framework, there are a number of
extensions which have been written to provide enhanced functionality, all of
which may be found on GitHub at the following location:

* [Test Case Extensions]
  (https://github.com/sesvxace/test-case/tree/master/lib/extensions)

The Assertions extension, in particular, is highly recommended -- but not
strictly necessary in order to write functional unit tests.
